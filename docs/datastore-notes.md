# Datastore Notes

Firestore in native mode acts as the persistent store for tasks.

- Enable the API and database as described in [Firestore documentation](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs).
- The Spring Cloud GCP Firestore starter provides a `FirestoreTemplate` for reactive document access.
